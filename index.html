    <h2>Computing Applications major</h2>
    <p>Computing Applications is the second bachelor's program I have attended, the first being in Korean at the University of 
        Hawai'i at Mānoa. This degree reinvigorated my interest in linguistics, specifically in Korean historical linguistics. 
        Their program is one of the best for Korean linguistics, and I intend to return for graduate school after completing 
        this degree.
    </p>
    <p>Linguistics research often requires knowledge of computers for data processing, so I felt this major would be a useful 
        one for pursuing my research goals. While I have some basic computer skills, like much of my generation, I don't have the 
        skills I felt were necessary to analyse language data on such a large scale, so I felt Computing Applications would give 
        the best foundation possible to build those skills.
